								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>So, you want to know more about me? Well you see back in 2000 I was born as a little brat in the ripe ol' land of Northern Ireland. On that day... Okay I won't go that indepth with my backstory. It wouldn't be as interesting as in TV or games since I can't do flashbacks. I am a student at Staffordshire University who is studying Computer Games Programming and doing voice acting on the side as a hobby.</p>
								<p>I am a gamer at heart, that is me in a nutshell. My entire life revolves around gaming and all associated with it. I wake up, play games, I go to university, I study making games. I go home, I try to voice in games. I eat, I watch people play games. To say my life is game oriented would be an understatement. Games are my life. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Portfolio</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>While studying I have been made to do work, whether it be from my own free will or the lectures are holding me hostage, I am not legally obliged to say... (send help). But seriously here are pieces of work which I have been creating over my time in university.</p>

						<!-- Voice Acting -->
							<article id="voiceActing">
								<h2 class="major">Voice Acting</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Programming games all the time isn't all I can do. I have a voice. And as much as it might bother people, I use my voice not to stand up against the oppressed or to yell about my rights. I use my voice in a much more meaningful way. I like to voice imaginative characters within video games. <i>Nope, still doesn't sound good even on paper.</i></p>
								<p>If you are interested in what my voice can do - and don't expect some skyrim words of power from using my voice, I aint at that level yet. Here is a link to my demo (or an empty space if for some reason this doesn't work - check back later it might not be empty forever)</p>
